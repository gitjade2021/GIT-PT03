To practice the basics of HTML, Letâ€™s try to answer an activity about writing and marking-up in HMTL (About Me Activity). Using the different style attributes, add a heading and style to your name that will be displayed on the center of the screen. Using the different HTML tags and style attributes you learned, mark up the text in your about me content to show what you think should be emphasized and highlighted. Make sure the content has a minimum of 10 sentences and must set its paragraph font size to 20-50px.
