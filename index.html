        My full name is <b>Christian Jade D. Guillen.</b> My nickname to most of my friends is Jade. Iâ€™m easy to get along with. I was born and raised in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte. I finished <mark>BS in Computer Science</mark> at Mariano Marcos State University in year 2014, and recently completed my Master's Degree in <mark>Master in Information Technology</mark> at the same University. I'm currently working as a full-time instructor at the College of Industrial Technology in the same University where I graduated and handle computer-related subjects, mostly programming. I love my job with a passion and I'm so lucky to get to do this for a living. My favorite color is green, but most of the time I wear black. My hobbies include biking, playing basketball, cooking (with a large amount of butter and garlic.), watching tutorial videos (mostly different programming languages), digital arts, and hanging out with family and friends. I'm passionate about everything I do. Summer is very much my season, and the beach is my spiritual base. I try to keep a healthy lifestyle, but every once in a while, icecream or chocolates are my go-to sweet treats. Honestly, openness and oversharing are my trademarks because I love hearing people laugh. <u>One of my goals in life is to finish  a Doctorate Degree overseas.</u> These are just few things about me.
